After using a few similar cryptocurrency unit converting apps I couldnâ€™t find one that had all the cryptos I was working with. I decided to fork crypto-unit-convert (to ensure base units are always integers) and implement it here for ease of use.

## Getting Started

Pull, then run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I have implimented this here https://crypto-convert.vercel.app/
